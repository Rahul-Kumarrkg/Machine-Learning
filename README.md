# Machine-Learning
A machine learning project for credit card fraud detection aims to build a system that can automatically identify fraudulent transactions by analyzing historical data. This involves using various machine learning algorithms to learn patterns associated with fraudulent activity and then using these patterns to predict whether new transactions are likely to be fraudulent. The project typically involves data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
